# AWSBot
Amazon Web Services Bot, or AWSBot, is an AI chatbot that provides information on AWS concepts and technologies.  APBot is a chatbot created using deep learning. It provides information on advanced persistent threat (APT) groups. The information I have used is from the official whitepapers and AWS resources.
