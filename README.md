# AWSBot
Amazon Web Services Bot, or AWSBot, is an AI chatbot that provides information on AWS concepts and technologies.  

AWSBot is a chatbot created using deep learning. It provides information on AWS technologies and services. The information I have used is from the official whitepapers and AWS resources.

To run the bot, use "python AWSBot.py" Before running the bot, make sure that you have all the requirements. Check the file "Requirements" for the full list.
